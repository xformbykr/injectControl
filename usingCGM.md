All of the information to be analyzed for injection decisions will come
from your CGM.  It records glucose readings every 5 minutes simply as a result
of starting up its sensor.  It can also record "events", including insulin injections,
carbohydrate consumption, period of exercise, and health status.  Managing diabetes
involves balancing carbohydrate consumption and insulin doses.  The openAPS
software uses the records of past insulin doses, past carbohydrate consumption,
and past glucose readings to recommend and control the next insulin doses.  We plan
to use the Dexcom G4 records in a similar way.

The Dexcom G4 User's Guide, Chapter 10, "Events and Dexcom Studio Software" explains 
how to enter INSULIN and CARBS (carbohydrate) event through the receiver user interface (buttons, arrows
and screen).  However, the G4 cannot display past events.  Fortunately, the openAPS software
provides methods for uploading both glucose and events into a database.

If you are using the G4, refer to the user manual for how to enter your insulin injections
and your carbohydrate consumption.  Then try to enter the events as you perform them:  injections
and carbohydrate consumption.  Yes, it is tedious to count carbohydrates, so perhaps a
"cheat sheet" for your frequent meals, dishes and treats could be helpful.
